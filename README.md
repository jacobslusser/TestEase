TestEase - Single File Test Framework
=====================================

TestEase is a [single file](https://github.com/jacobslusser/TestEase/blob/master/TestEase/TestEase.cs) that can be dropped into any project and give you instant support for discovering unit tests, running test methods, and doing what you will with the results. Add it to a console application and get an instant test runner you can share with your team. Add it to your build process to smoke test your last commit. Wrap it with a GUI! The possibilities are endless.

You are the test writer and runnerâ€”all in one. No more clumsy executables, dependencies, or painful configuration.
